Explanation,

We define a schema for the Transactions collection with a saleAmount field.
We create an API endpoint /bar-chart/:month that takes the month as a parameter.
We use the aggregate method to process the data.
We use the $match stage to filter the transactions to only include those with the selected month.
We use the $bucket stage to group the transactions by price range. We define the boundaries for each range using the boundaries array.
We use the output field to specify that we want to count the number of transactions in each range.
We map the resulting data to a format that's easy to consume for the bar chart, with priceRange and count properties.
